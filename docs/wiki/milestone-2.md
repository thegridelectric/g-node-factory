## Additional goals

Move the aspect of the GNodeFactory that maintains a shared comprehension of the topology of the electric grid
into a smart contract. This way, as the system scales, there is not a centralized application as the source of truth
for this collectively built knowledge. We plan to use Jason Paulos' [algoship game](https://github.com/jasonpaulos/algoship) as inspiration.

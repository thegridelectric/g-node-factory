### Why the low-voltage electric grid topology matters

---

Imagine we have a large cul-de-sac where all the people living there have gone all-in on this premise. They have converted their gas and oil space and hot water heating to heat pumps coupled with thermal stores. They've traded all their gas vehicles for EVs. And all these electrical appliances are paying attention to the wholesale price of electricity and doing their very best to buy in the lowest-cost wholesale hours (which is in fact closely aligned with using low-carbon electricity.)

In this scenario, the local low-voltage lines and transformers serving this cul-de-sac will likely catch fire.

We give a thumbnail explanation of this. The electric grid is a somewhat hierarchical graph. To a first approximation, most of the constraints on power flow happen at places where voltage changes, called sub-stations. The graph is pretty well instrumented and modeled at the high-voltage levels, where the grid operators operate the lines and run markets (think of the markets as the grid operator's first and best tool for grid operation). However, the graph at the lower voltages is not very well mapped out. Distribution utilities own and maintain these lines. Some of these utilities have decent 1-line diagrams of their lines but most are partial, only in paper-based records, or both. But what can absolutely be said is that when these lines were designed, it was with the assumption that **load ignored the electric grid** and that a healthy dose of the central limit theorem could be applied. Also, of course, the lines were not designed to serve all-electric households.

What this means is that we need to play a game of battleship with the grid topology. As new transactive load is built, it needs to be participatory in discovering the unknown topological structure.
